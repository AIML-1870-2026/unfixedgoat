# AI and Your Future Career: Orthopedic Spine Surgery
**A Research Report on Artificial Intelligence's Impact on Neuroscience and Surgical Medicine**

---

## 1. My Field and Career Goals

I am a first-year student studying neuroscience with a minor in chemistry and Spanish for health sciences. My goal is to attend medical school and pursue a career in orthopedic spine surgery, though I remain open to ophthalmology as an alternative specialty.

What draws me to spine surgery is the combination of technical precision, immediate patient impact, and the complexity of spinal anatomy and biomechanics. Through shadowing experiences with orthopedic surgeons, I've witnessed how these specialists transform patients' quality of life by addressing debilitating pain and mobility issues. The field represents both an intellectual challenge and a rewarding clinical practice that aligns with my interests in neuroscience, anatomy, and surgical intervention.

My neuroscience background positions me to understand the intersection of neural function and musculoskeletal health, particularly in cases where spinal pathology affects neurological function. This foundation will serve me well as AI increasingly bridges imaging analysis, surgical planning, and patient outcomes prediction.

## 2. AI's Current Presence in Spine Surgery and Related Fields

### Diagnostic and Imaging Analysis

Artificial intelligence has become deeply embedded in orthopedic imaging and surgical planning. According to recent systematic reviews, **AI-driven imaging analysis, anatomical segmentation, and implant selection are improving surgical precision, efficiency, and patient-specific customization**. AI-driven tools excel at interpreting spinal imaging, reliably identifying fractures, stenosis, and tumors, while reconstructing 3D spine images and reducing radiation exposure ([Cureus, 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12538659/)).

The FDA has approved over **1,039 radiology-specific AI devices** as of December 2025, with radiology securing 75% of total AI authorizations ([The Imaging Wire, 2025](https://theimagingwire.com/2025/12/10/ai-enabled-medical-devices-granted-fda-marketing-authorization/)). A systematic review found that 950 AI/ML devices were authorized by the FDA, of which 723 were radiology devices—representing 76% of all approvals ([JAMA Network Open, 2024](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841066)).

### Intraoperative Guidance and Surgical Robotics

AI has been incorporated into intraoperative imaging utilizing fluoroscopy, CT, MRI, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). **Machine learning was used to develop methods by which intraoperative X-ray studies could be converted into 3D reconstructions** to aid in real-time navigation and decision-making ([Sage Journals, 2025](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21925682241290752)).

Robotic spine surgery systems are being adopted, though implementation remains limited due to costs ranging from **$700,000 to $1,500,000** per system. Clinical studies show these robots achieve 89-99% accuracy, though widespread adoption faces barriers ([PMC, 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11843566/)).

### Preoperative Planning and Personalized Medicine

The integration of AI and finite element analysis (FEA) is **reshaping modern spine care by improving biomechanical modeling, enhancing surgical precision, and enabling personalized treatment strategies**. This synergy is transforming preoperative planning, intraoperative execution, and postoperative outcome prediction ([Springer, 2025](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11701-025-02772-w)).

Industry experts predict that **2026 marks the inflection point where AI-driven spine care moves from concept to clinical reality**, with the emerging "Intelligence-Based Spine Care Model" leveraging algorithms to integrate imaging, comorbidities, functional scores, and historical outcomes ([Becker's Spine Review, 2025](https://www.beckersspine.com/spine/what-will-define-spine-in-2026-22-predictions/)).

### Neuroscience Research Applications

In my undergraduate field of neuroscience, AI is transforming brain imaging analysis in ways directly relevant to spine surgery. AI techniques including machine learning, deep learning, and quantum computing are being applied to **automated MRI segmentation and disease prediction**, with quantum-enhanced networks like QBrainNet achieving 96% accuracy in stroke prediction ([Frontiers, 2025](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2025.1755373/full)).

Stanford researchers have created ultra-sensitive optical instruments that reveal neuronal brain wave activity more clearly than ever before, while new AI tools can non-invasively track brain aging pace by analyzing MRI scans ([Stanford Report, 2025](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/07/new-tech-imaging-brain-waves-could-advance-disease-research-ai); [USC Leonard Davis School, 2025](https://gero.usc.edu/2025/02/24/new-ai-model-measures-how-fast-the-brain-ages/)).

## 3. The Opportunities: How AI Could Enhance Spine Surgery

### Reduced Administrative Burden and Clinical Efficiency

One of AI's most promising near-term benefits is **reducing the documentation burden** that currently consumes physicians' time and contributes to burnout. AI-powered natural language processing can automate clinical documentation, allowing surgeons to spend more time on patient care and complex decision-making rather than paperwork ([Ophthalmology Times, 2025](https://www.ophthalmologytimes.com/view/how-ai-is-reshaping-ophthalmology-in-2025-and-beyond)).

### Enhanced Surgical Precision and Patient Safety

AI enables **real-time image-guided navigation, robotic assistance, and automated anatomical recognition, reducing the risk of surgical error**. Machine learning facilitates automated 3D segmentation of the spine and suggested placement of pedicle screws based on intraoperative cone-beam CT ([Cureus, 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12538659/)).

This technology is particularly valuable in complex spinal anatomy cases, deformity corrections, and minimally invasive procedures where visualization is limited. The ability to convert 2D fluoroscopy into real-time 3D reconstructions provides surgeons with unprecedented intraoperative awareness.

### Improved Patient Outcomes Through Personalized Planning

AI's ability to analyze vast datasets enables **personalized surgical planning** that accounts for individual patient anatomy, biomechanics, comorbidities, and predicted outcomes. This shift from standardized protocols to individualized strategies promises better functional outcomes and fewer complications ([SurgiColl, 2025](https://surgicoll.scholasticahq.com/article/137606-artificial-intelligence-in-orthopedic-surgery-a-practical-overview-of-current-applications-and-trends)).

The integration of AI with outcomes databases will allow surgeons to learn from thousands of previous cases, identifying which approaches work best for patients with similar characteristics.

### Addressing Workforce Shortages

Critically, **orthopedic surgery faces a projected shortage of 5,050+ surgeons by 2025**, with wait times averaging 20 days ([Zippia, 2025](https://www.zippia.com/orthopedic-surgeon-jobs/trends/)). AI tools that improve efficiency and enable faster, safer surgeries help address this demand-supply gap without compromising care quality.

AI is not displacing surgeons; it's being deployed because there aren't enough surgeons to meet growing demand from aging populations. Over 1.4 million knee and hip arthroplasties were performed in 2022 alone, with spinal procedures also increasing substantially.

### New Career Opportunities

AI is creating new subspecialty roles for physicians who understand both clinical medicine and AI systems. Opportunities include:
- **AI-assisted surgical planning specialists** who optimize preoperative imaging analysis
- **Clinical AI implementation leaders** who integrate new technologies into hospital systems
- **Physician-data scientists** who develop and validate AI tools for surgical applications
- **Medical educators** teaching the next generation of AI-literate physicians

## 4. The Challenges: Risks and Concerns for Future Spine Surgeons

### The Risk of Deskilling and Over-Reliance

My primary concern about AI integration is **becoming deskilled or too reliant on AI systems**. Medical education research has identified "de-skilling" as a real phenomenon—when overreliance on AI causes clinicians to lose core competencies ([Penn LDI, 2025](https://ldi.upenn.edu/our-work/research-updates/ai-pushes-medical-schools-into-new-era-but-are-they-prepared/)).

A surprising study found that **when AI worked independently, it achieved 92% diagnostic accuracy, but when physicians used AI assistance, they only reached 76% accuracy**—barely better than the 74% they achieved without AI ([Eric Topol Substack, 2025](https://erictopol.substack.com/p/when-doctors-with-ai-are-outperformed)). This paradox suggests that AI integration isn't automatically beneficial; it requires thoughtful implementation and physician AI literacy.

If residents train primarily with AI-assisted navigation and planning, will they develop the spatial reasoning and anatomical intuition needed when technology fails or isn't available? Rural hospitals and international medical work often lack cutting-edge technology—surgeons must maintain fundamental skills independent of AI.

### Economic Pressures and Reimbursement Decline

While spine surgery remains lucrative, economic trends are concerning. **Orthopedic surgeon salaries declined 38% when adjusted for inflation over the past 20 years**—the worst decline of all healthcare professions studied. The average orthopedic surgeon salary fell 3% year-over-year in 2025 to $543,000, primarily due to Medicare reimbursement cuts ([Becker's Spine Review, 2025](https://www.beckersspine.com/orthopedic/how-orthopedic-pay-stacks-up-in-2025/); [The Journal of Arthroplasty, 2025](https://www.arthroplastyjournal.org/article/S0883-5403(25)00140-8/abstract)).

As AI improves surgical efficiency, payers may argue for lower reimbursement rates, claiming procedures require less time and expertise. Surgeons might face pressure to perform more procedures in less time, potentially compromising quality and increasing burnout.

### Limitations of Current AI Systems

AI has three key limitations in surgical contexts:

1. **Lack of judgment and clinical reasoning**: AI systems cannot exercise nuanced appreciation of a patient's unique condition at a specific juncture—they adhere to pre-established rules without true understanding ([PMC, 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12474520/)).

2. **Inability to handle unexpected complications**: When anatomy varies significantly, complications arise, or judgment calls are needed, surgeons depend on human adaptability and pattern recognition that current AI lacks ([ScienceDirect, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949916X24000938)).

3. **Absence of empathy and ethical reasoning**: In decision-intensive or ethically complex cases—such as recommending surgery versus conservative treatment, or managing patients with unrealistic expectations—AI cannot replace human judgment, context sensitivity, or empathy ([PMC, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5995666/)).

### Integration Challenges and Learning Curve

The rapid evolution of AI tools creates a continuous learning burden. AI usage among physicians nearly doubled from 38% in 2023 to 66% in 2024, yet **only 12% of medical faculty report being "very familiar" with AI technology** despite 86% understanding its importance ([Frontiers, 2025](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2025.1556921/full)).

Medical students and physicians report feeling **excluded from AI development processes**, which lowers trust and hinders adoption. Primary concerns include workflow disruptions, reliability questions, and interoperability issues between systems (cited by 69% of physicians) ([Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2025](https://www.jmir.org/2025/1/e74187)).

The "readiness paradox" shows high enthusiasm without corresponding knowledge, implementation without formal training infrastructure, and safety concerns coexisting with actual unsupervised AI usage. This disconnect could lead to misuse of AI tools or failure to recognize their limitations.

### Regulatory and Liability Questions

When AI-assisted surgical planning contributes to a poor outcome, who bears responsibility? These liability frameworks remain unclear. If a surgeon follows AI recommendations that prove incorrect, does that constitute negligence or reasonable reliance on standard technology?

As AI becomes standard of care, failure to use it might itself become grounds for malpractice claims, creating pressure to adopt systems even when clinical judgment suggests otherwise.

## 5. My Response: Adapting for a Future Alongside AI

### Strategic Skill Development

Given these opportunities and challenges, my strategy focuses on building skills that complement AI rather than compete with it:

**Core Clinical Competencies**: I will prioritize developing strong foundational skills during medical school and residency—anatomy, physical examination, clinical reasoning, and manual surgical technique. These fundamentals become even more critical in an AI-augmented environment, providing the base knowledge needed to recognize AI errors and maintain competence when technology isn't available.

**AI Literacy Without Specialization**: For now, I'll focus on traditional pre-med coursework to build the medical foundation needed for competitive medical school applications. However, if AI integration progresses as predicted by the time I reach medical school (2028-2029), I'll seek opportunities to gain practical AI literacy through electives, workshops, or extracurricular projects. The goal isn't to become a computer scientist, but to understand AI capabilities, limitations, and appropriate clinical applications.

My neuroscience background already positions me well—I understand neural networks conceptually and appreciate the relationship between computational models and human neural processing. This foundation will help me grasp how AI algorithms analyze imaging data and make predictions.

**Human-Centered Skills**: I'll emphasize developing judgment, empathy, communication, and ethical reasoning—capabilities that AI cannot replicate. These include:
- Complex shared decision-making with patients facing ambiguous choices
- Adaptability when complications arise intraoperatively
- Managing patients with psychosocial factors affecting surgical outcomes
- Navigating ethical dilemmas around surgical appropriateness

### Seeking Meaningful Technology Experience

During medical school, I'll seek clinical rotations and research opportunities involving AI-assisted surgical planning or robotic surgery. Observing how experienced surgeons integrate AI into their workflow—when they trust it, when they question it, and how they maintain skills despite technology—will provide invaluable learning.

If possible, I'll pursue research projects examining AI implementation in orthopedic surgery, outcomes comparison studies, or human factors research on surgeon-AI interaction. Understanding the evidence base for AI tools critically, rather than accepting marketing claims, will make me a more discerning adopter of technology.

### Building Surgical Judgment Deliberately

To counter the deskilling risk, I'll consciously practice skills even when AI could perform them faster:
- Manually interpreting imaging before checking AI analysis
- Planning procedures independently before reviewing AI-generated plans
- Seeking opportunities to operate in lower-resource settings where technology is limited

The goal is to use AI as a second opinion and verification tool, not a crutch that prevents development of independent capability.

### Positioning for Long-Term Career Success

The surgeons who thrive will be those who combine technical excellence, AI literacy, and distinctively human judgment. By 2036-2041 (when I complete residency), AI will be deeply embedded in spine surgery, but the workforce shortage will persist. **Surgeons who can leverage AI effectively while maintaining strong clinical skills will be highly valuable**.

I'll also monitor economic trends carefully. If reimbursement continues declining while educational debt increases, I may need to consider fellowship training in high-value subspecialties, geographic areas with better compensation, or hybrid careers combining clinical practice with medical education or AI development roles.

## 6. Reflection: What Surprised Me Most

What surprised me most was the **magnitude of the workforce shortages** in both orthopedic surgery and ophthalmology. I entered this research somewhat anxious that AI would eliminate career opportunities in these fields. Instead, I discovered that both specialties face dramatic shortages—5,050+ orthopedic surgeons by 2025 and a 30% workforce inadequacy in ophthalmology by 2035.

This realization fundamentally changed my perspective. AI isn't being developed to replace surgeons; it's being deployed because there aren't enough of us to meet growing demand from aging populations. The question isn't whether I'll have a job as a spine surgeon, but whether I'll have the skills to leverage AI tools that make me more efficient and effective.

The second surprise was the **deskilling paradox**—the finding that physicians using AI assistance performed worse than AI working alone. This reinforced my concern about over-reliance and highlighted that AI integration requires thoughtful implementation, not blind adoption. The relationship between surgeon and AI matters enormously; technology is not automatically beneficial.

Finally, I was struck by how **rapidly AI adoption is accelerating despite limited formal training**. Physician AI usage doubled in one year (38% to 66%), yet only 12% of medical faculty feel very familiar with the technology. This gap between adoption and understanding creates both risk and opportunity. Students who proactively develop AI literacy will have an advantage, but we must ensure this doesn't come at the expense of fundamental clinical skills.

This research hasn't made me fear AI or question my career choice. Instead, it's clarified the skills I need to develop and the strategic approach I should take. The future of spine surgery will be neither "AI replacing surgeons" nor "surgeons ignoring AI," but rather a collaboration where technology handles tasks it excels at (data analysis, pattern recognition, real-time navigation) while surgeons provide judgment, adaptability, and human connection that AI cannot replicate.

I'm proceeding with confidence, knowing that the surgeons who understand both the promise and the limitations of AI—who use it as a tool rather than a crutch—will be the ones who thrive in the coming decades.
